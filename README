ipython access to the odyssey cluster

TODO
------
get pyzmq actually working on odyssey
test out launch nodes: see pbs notes in ipython doc
sort out client/controller ssh tunneling
make templates
code & test

Basic Structure
------

host : your computer (where ipython terminal/notebook is running)
    must be ssh accessible from each odyssey node
    and able to ssh into the head node
head node : odyssey login node
node(s) : odyssey compute node

1) negotiate ssh connection with head node
2) copy over (or create) job scripts that:
    A) fetch ipython security info (do this on head node?)
    B) ssh tunnel from nodes to host
    C) start up an ipengine
3) start a ipcontroller on host (that connects to the node ipengines)

alternate (possibly easier)
1) negotiate ssh connection with head node
2) launch controller & engines on cluster
3) have controller scp data to host
4) go ahead and separately launch clients

Needs
------
killing of specific & all nodes
